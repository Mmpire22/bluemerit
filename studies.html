                                    <p>Every year, more than 642,000 foreign students travel from around the world to study 
                                        in Canada. And it is easy to see why. <br><br>
                                        Canada has become an ideal place for higher education studies, sought by many prospective 
                                        international students. Many of the Canadian universities are present in reputed 
                                        international rankings and a recent educational strategy set by the Canadian Ministry
                                         of Education stresses on increasing the number of foreign students. 
                                        <br><br>
                                        No longer an overlooked global destination to earn a degree, Canada also offers a direct path 
                                        to permanent citizenship - an option many international students seek. Canada has 
                                        ranked as one of the top ten places to live in the world for over twenty years, and 
                                        boasts an education system ranked among the best. <br><br>

                                            The USA has the world’s largest international student population, with more than 1,000,000 
                                            students choosing to broaden their education and life experience in the United States. Nearly 
                                            5% of all students enrolled in higher-level education in the USA are international students, 
                                            and the numbers are growing. From the mid-1950’s, when international student enrollment was 
                                            only just reaching 35,000, international education in the USA has come a long way.

                                                            supported American universities are, but it also has to do with the high academic standards

                                                            so that they can attempt to pursue a wonderful career at some of the world’s biggest companies. In 2016, a

                                                        international students. International students pay $25,000-$35,000 per year at a public university

                                                        bachelor’s degree because community colleges provide 2-year courses. They can charge you $2500-$3000 per 
                                                        year. You can use the associate’s degree as a qualification for the first half of your bachelor’s degree 
                                                        and later you can apply for a master’s degree as well.

                                                            is definitely one of the cheapest European countries to live in, with the prices for

                                    features which are unique to each single city. <br><br>

                                    For example, İstanbul is the only city in the world that connects two continents. <br><br>

                                    The city, which is located in both Asia and Europe, has been the capital city 
                                    for many civilizations for thousands of years throughout its history. <br><br>

                                    The Turkish government is easing students’ lives by simplifying visa and resident permit 
                                    procedures. Unlike before, Resident permit applications are now submitted throughout 
                                    universities directly to migration offices.

                                    Turkey has enormous Turkish companies that welcome interns and international students.
                                    There are a lot of job opportunities in the Turkish market for foreigners in both 
                                    Turkish and international companies. <br><br>
