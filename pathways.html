                                The UK is one of the most popular countries to travel to for the purpose of 
                                earning an education. Generations of international students have come to the UK 
                                for their education, which means that British universities have decades of 
                                experience in working with international students.  <br>
                                Foreign students do not only get the chance of earning excellent education, 
                                but they also find ways of enjoying their stay in the UK.

                                The USA has the world’s largest international student population, with more than 1,000,000 
                                students choosing to broaden their education and life experience in the United States. Nearly 
                                5% of all students enrolled in higher-level education in the USA are international students, 
                                and the numbers are growing. From the mid-1950’s, when international student enrollment was 
                                only just reaching 35,000, international education in the USA has come a long way.

                                Turkey is an attraction to everyone in the world because of the spiritual and physical 
                                features which are unique to each single city.<BR>
                                For example, İstanbul is the only city in the world that connects two continents.
                                The city, which is located in both Asia and Europe, has been the capital 
                                city for many civilizations for thousands of years throughout its history.

                                The meeting ground between Europe and the Middle East, Azerbaijan is sandwiched 
                                between Russia to the north and Iran to the south. It also borders Georgia to the 
                                north-west, Armenia to the west and the Caspian Sea to the east. The smaller 
                                Nakhchivan Exclave is nestled between Armenia, Iran and Turkey. Azerbaijan is 
                                politically allied to Russia but culturally intertwined with Turkey. This sets 
                                the stage for Azerbaijan as one of the more interesting countries in the world.   
                                <br>
                                For a small country, Azerbaijan is home to nine universities. All offer programs taught in 
                                English. However, three of them, the Western Caspian University, the Baku State
                                 University and the Baku Engineering University, are the most prestigious in the c
                                 ountry. These three universities award degrees that are recognized in most 
                                 countries and are seen as being prestigious across the wider Caucasus, parts
                                  of the Middle East and in Russia.
