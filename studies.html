                                    <p>Every year, more than 642,000 foreign students travel from around the world to study 
                                        in Canada. And it is easy to see why. <br><br>
                                        Canada has become an ideal place for higher education studies, sought by many prospective 
                                        international students. Many of the Canadian universities are present in reputed 
                                        international rankings and a recent educational strategy set by the Canadian Ministry
                                         of Education stresses on increasing the number of foreign students. 
                                        <br><br>
                                        No longer an overlooked global destination to earn a degree, Canada also offers a direct path 
                                        to permanent citizenship - an option many international students seek. Canada has 
                                        ranked as one of the top ten places to live in the world for over twenty years, and 
                                        boasts an education system ranked among the best. <br><br>

                                                            needs and interests. Students can choose between universities, vocational education, and English language

                                            There are eight universities in Ireland, all providing a wide variety of undergraduate or postgraduate 
                                            courses to the 35,000 international students from 160 countries who currently study there. Located on 
                                            the western coast of Europe, Ireland is a member of the European Union and, following Brexit, will 
                                            soon be the only English speaking country in the Eurozone. Irish universities offer a fantastic higher 
                                            education experience in a uniquely beautiful setting. <br><br>
                                            Irish qualifications are the same as the UK equivalents, so your undergraduate or postgraduate degree 
                                            carries just as much value when you begin your career. The Free Fees Initiative for EU students 
                                            enables those who meet the criteria to avoid paying tuition fees.

                                            The USA has the world’s largest international student population, with more than 1,000,000 
                                            students choosing to broaden their education and life experience in the United States. Nearly 
                                            5% of all students enrolled in higher-level education in the USA are international students, 
                                            and the numbers are growing. From the mid-1950’s, when international student enrollment was 
                                            only just reaching 35,000, international education in the USA has come a long way.

                                                        international students. International students pay $25,000-$35,000 per year at a public university

                                                        bachelor’s degree because community colleges provide 2-year courses. They can charge you $2500-$3000 per 
                                                        year. You can use the associate’s degree as a qualification for the first half of your bachelor’s degree 
                                                        and later you can apply for a master’s degree as well.

                                    Turkey is an attraction to everyone in the world because of the spiritual and physical 
                                    features which are unique to each single city. <br><br>

                                    For example, İstanbul is the only city in the world that connects two continents. <br><br>

                                    The city, which is located in both Asia and Europe, has been the capital city 
                                    for many civilizations for thousands of years throughout its history. <br><br>

                                    The Turkish government is easing students’ lives by simplifying visa and resident permit 
                                    procedures. Unlike before, Resident permit applications are now submitted throughout 
                                    universities directly to migration offices.

                                    Turkey has enormous Turkish companies that welcome interns and international students.
                                    There are a lot of job opportunities in the Turkish market for foreigners in both 
                                    Turkish and international companies. <br><br>
